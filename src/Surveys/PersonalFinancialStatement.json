SBA has issued regulations and procedures that implement these laws and executive orders. These are\ncontained in Parts 112, 113, and 117 of Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations and in Standard Operating\nProcedures\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a)</b><br>\nAny person can request to see or get copies of any personal information that SBA has in his or her file when that file is\nretrieved by individual identifiers such as name or social security numbers. Requests for information about another party\nmay be denied unless SBA has the written permission of the individual to release the information to the requestor or\nunless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnder the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to provide\nyour social security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. Disclosures of name\nand other personal identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an individual seeking assistance from\nSBA to provide it with sufficient information for it to make a character determination. In determining whether an\nindividual is of good character, SBA considers the person’s integrity, candor, and disposition toward criminal actions.\nAdditionally, SBA is specifically authorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section\n7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B) of the Small Business Act ( the Act). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is\nauthorized to make all investigations necessary to ensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate\nthe Act or the Small Business Investment Act, 15 USC Sections 634(b)(11) and 687(b)(a), respectively. For these\npurposes, you are asked to voluntarily provide your social security number to assist SBA in making a character\ndetermination and to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar name or other personal identifier.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain “routine uses” of information protected by that Act. One such routine\nuse is the disclosure of information maintained in SBA’s investigative files system of records when this information\nindicates a violation or potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or administrative in nature. Specifically, SBA\nmay refer the information to the appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with responsibility\nfor, or otherwise involved in investigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine use\nis that SBA may disclose the information maintained in SBA’s investigative files to other Federal agencies conducting\nbackground checks to the extent the information is relevant to the requesting agencies' function. In addition, another\nroutine use is that SBA may transfer information related to a debt that a person is delinquent in paying to SBA in\nconnection with its loan programs for publication on a computer database system maintained by the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, or other Federal agency, to allow searches by participating Government agencies and\napproved private lenders, consistent with applicable law. SBA and its authorized lenders may also use this computer\ndatabase system to perform a computer match to determine a loan applicant’s credit status with participating agencies of\nthe Federal Government. See Revision of Privacy Act System of Records, 74 F.R. 14890 (April 1, 2009) and 77 F.R.\n61467 (October 9, 2012) for additional background and other routine uses, which may be amended from time to time.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401) --</b> This is notice to you as required by the Right to Financial\nPrivacy Act of 1978, of SBA's access rights to financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing\nbusiness with you or your business, including any financial institutions participating in a loan or loan guaranty. The law\nprovides that SBA shall have a right of access to your financial records in connection with its consideration or\nadministration of assistance to you in the form of a Government guaranteed loan. SBA is required to provide a certificate\nof its compliance with the Act to a financial institution in connection with its first request for access to your financial\nrecords, after which no further certification is required for subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access\nrights continue for the term of any approved loan guaranty agreement.

The law also authorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority\nany financial records included in an application for a loan, or concerning an approved loan or loan guarantee, as necessary\nto process, service or foreclose on a loan guaranty or collect on a defaulted loan guaranty.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552)</b><br>\nThis law provides, with some exceptions, that SBA must supply information reflected in agency files and records to a\nperson requesting it.

These regulations prohibit SBA from\nmaking certain loans in an FIA designated floodplain unless Federal Flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the\nloan. Failure to maintain the required level of flood insurance makes the applicant ineligible for any financial assistance\nfrom SBA, including disaster assistance.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Executive Orders -- Floodplain Management and Wetland Protection (42 F.R. 26951 and 42 F.R. 26961)</b> – SBA\ndiscourages settlement in or development of a floodplain or a wetland.

Therefore, SBA may require additional information from an applicant to determine whether the business will\nbe in compliance with OSHA regulations and allowed to operate its facility after the loan is approved and disbursed.\nSigning this form as an applicant is certification that the OSHA requirements that apply to the applicant business have\nbeen determined and that the applicant, to the best of its knowledge, is in compliance. Furthermore, applicant certifies that\nit will remain in compliance during the life of the loan.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Civil Rights Legislation --</b> All businesses receiving SBA financial assistance must agree not to discriminate in any\nbusiness practice, including employment practices and services to the public on the basis of categories cited in 13 C.F.R.,\nParts 112, 113, and 117 of SBA Regulations.

SBA must obtain your taxpayer\nidentification number when you apply for a loan.

When you\nsign this document, you are making the certification that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 does not apply\nto you, or if it does apply, more than five years have elapsed since you have been granted lawful temporary resident status\npursuant to such 1986 legislation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821 et seq.) --</b> Borrowers using SBA funds for the\nconstruction or rehabilitation of a residential structure are prohibited from using lead-based paint (as defined in SBA\nregulations) on all interior surfaces, whether accessible or not, and exterior surfaces, such as stairs, decks, porches,\nrailings, windows and doors, which are readily accessible to children under 7 years of age.
