Requests for information\nabout another party may be denied unless SBA has the written permission of the individual to release the information to the\nrequestor or unless the information is subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.\n</p>\n<p>\nUnder the provisions of the Privacy Act, you are not required to provide your social security number. Failure to provide your\nsocial security number may not affect any right, benefit or privilege to which you are entitled. Disclosures of name and other\npersonal identifiers are, however, required for a benefit, as SBA requires an individual seeking assistance from SBA to provide it\nwith sufficient information for it to make a character determination. In determining whether an individual is of good character,\nSBA considers the person’s integrity, candor, and disposition toward criminal actions. Additionally, SBA is specifically\nauthorized to verify your criminal history, or lack thereof, pursuant to section 7(a)(1)(B), 15 USC Section 636(a)(1)(B) of the\nSmall Business Act ( the Act). Further, for all forms of assistance, SBA is authorized to make all investigations necessary to\nensure that a person has not engaged in acts that violate or will violate the Act or the Small Business Investment Act, 15 USC\nSections 634(b)(11) and 687(b)(a), respectively. For these purposes, you are asked to voluntarily provide your social security\nnumber to assist SBA in making a character determination and to distinguish you from other individuals with the same or similar\nname or other personal identifier.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Privacy Act authorizes SBA to make certain “routine uses” of information protected by that Act. One such routine use is the\ndisclosure of information maintained in SBA’s investigative files system of records when this information indicates a violation\nor potential violation of law, whether civil, criminal, or administrative in nature. Specifically, SBA may refer the information to\nthe appropriate agency, whether Federal, State, local or foreign, charged with responsibility for, or otherwise involved in\ninvestigation, prosecution, enforcement or prevention of such violations. Another routine use is disclosure to other Federal\nagencies conducting background checks; only to the extent the information is relevant to the requesting agencies' function. See,\n74 F.R. 14890 (2009), and as amended from time to time for additional background and other routine uses.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3401) --</b> This is notice to you as required by the Right to Financial Privacy\nAct of 1978, of SBA's access rights to financial records held by financial institutions that are or have been doing business with\nyou or your business, including any financial institutions participating in a loan or loan guaranty. The law provides that SBA\nshall have a right of access to your financial records in connection with its consideration or administration of assistance to you in\nthe form of a Government guaranteed loan. SBA is required to provide a certificate of its compliance with the Act to a financial\ninstitution in connection with its first request for access to your financial records, after which no further certification is required\nfor subsequent accesses. The law also provides that SBA's access rights continue for the term of any approved loan guaranty\nagreement. No further notice to you of SBA's access rights is required during the term of any such agreement. The law also\nauthorizes SBA to transfer to another Government authority any financial records included in an application for a loan, or\nconcerning an approved loan or loan guarantee, as necessary to process, service or foreclose on a loan guaranty or collect on a\ndefaulted loan guaranty.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) --</b> This law provides, with some exceptions, that SBA must supply information\nreflected in agency files and records to a person requesting it. Information about approved loans that will be automatically\nreleased includes, among other things, statistics on our loan programs (individual borrowers are not identified in the statistics)\nand other information such as the names of the borrowers (and their officers, directors, stockholders or partners), the collateral\npledged to secure the loan, the amount of the loan, its purpose in general terms and the maturity. Proprietary data on a borrower\nwould not routinely be made available to third parties. All requests under this Act are to be addressed to the nearest SBA office\nand be identified as a Freedom of Information request.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Flood Disaster Protection Act (42 U.S.C. 4011) --</b> Regulations have been issued by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)\nand by SBA implementing this Act and its amendments. These regulations prohibit SBA from making certain loans in an FIA\ndesignated floodplain unless Federal Flood insurance is purchased as a condition of the loan. Failure to maintain the required\nlevel of flood insurance makes the applicant ineligible for any financial assistance from SBA, including disaster assistance.\n</p>"
